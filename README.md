# Wordle LOL

I have some good friends who play wordle every day. They're good at it and they post their results in a slack channel. I'm a cheater at wordle and I spent months using my wordle solver to post my own solutions. But it got a little boring. My friends are just too smart. I might be able to beat them in total guesses over lots of days, but on any individual day, the results of my solver just aren't that impressive. Plus it's quite boring for all involved. So instead, I've decided that I'm going play the same pattern every day for a bit.

Let's see how this goes.
